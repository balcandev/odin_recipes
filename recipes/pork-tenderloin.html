    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 pound pork tenderloin</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh sage, leaves removed and stems discarded, divided</li>
        <li>6 ounces prosciutto</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or more as needed</li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <br>

        <li>Lightly season pork with salt and black pepper. Arrange about 6 sage leaves over tenderloin. Wrap prosciutto around tenderloin and sage, overlapping prosciutto slightly; wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate to allow prosciutto to set on pork tenderloin, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove plastic wrap.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry wrapped tenderloin in the hot oil until prosciutto is crispy and lightly browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer wrapped tenderloin to a baking dish, reserving oil in the skillet.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>Bake tenderloin in the preheated oven until pork is cooked through, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>Heat reserved oil in the skillet over medium heat; fry remaining sage leaves until crispy, adding more oil as needed, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <br>
        
        <li>Slice tenderloin and serve with crispy sage leaves.</li>
      </ol>
